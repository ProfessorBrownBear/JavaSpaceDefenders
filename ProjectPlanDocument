Designing a "Space Defenders" game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java and IntelliJ IDEA will give you a great opportunity to apply OOP concepts practically. 
Here's an outline to get you started on this project:

**Setting Up Your Environment

Install Java: Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
IntelliJ IDEA: Download and install IntelliJ IDEA. It's a powerful IDE for Java development.
Project Setup: Create a new Java project in IntelliJ. Organize your source files and resources.
Designing the Game - "Space Defenders"

**Conceptualization

Gameplay: The game will be text-based, played using console word commands.

Objective: Players defend their base from incoming space enemies.

Implementing OOP Concepts

Classes and Objects

Game Class: Manages the game's state and loops.

Player Class: Represents the player, with properties like health, score, and methods to move or attack.

Enemy Class: For the space enemies, with properties (health, speed) and behaviors (advance, attack).

Weapon Class: Define various weapons or defenses the player can use.


Inheritance and Polymorphism

You might have different types of enemies or weapons, which can inherit from a base class and override certain behaviors.


Encapsulation and Abstraction

Keep internal workings of classes private, exposing only what is necessary to other parts of your code.


Game Logic and Flow

Input Handling: Implement a way to read and process console commands.

Game Loop: A loop that keeps the game running, updating game state, and rendering outputs to the console.

Collision Detection: Logic to detect interactions between player attacks and enemies.

Interface and Interaction

Since it's a console-based game, design a clear and user-friendly way to display game status and messages.

Create a command system for player actions like "move", "shoot", "defend".

Coding in IntelliJ

Use IntelliJâ€™s powerful features like code completion, refactoring tools, and debugging capabilities to write and maintain your code efficiently.

Testing and Iteration

Regularly test each component.

Use IntelliJ's debugging tools to troubleshoot and fine-tune your game.

Remember, game development is an iterative process. Start with simple implementations and gradually add complexity. 
Make sure to frequently test and refine your game to ensure it's engaging and bug-free. 
Enjoy the process of bringing "Space Defenders" to life!
