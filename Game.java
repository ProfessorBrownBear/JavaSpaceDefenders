Creating a `Game` class in Java to manage your "Space Defenders" game involves setting up the basic structure for the game loop and state management. 
  Below is a simple example of how you might structure this class. Remember, this is a foundational framework that you can expand upon based on your game's specific requirements.

```java
public class Game {
    private boolean isRunning;
    private Player player;
    private List<Enemy> enemies;
    private int score;

    public Game() {
        this.isRunning = true;
        this.player = new Player(); // Assume Player class exists
        this.enemies = new ArrayList<>();
        this.score = 0;

        // Initialize enemies
        initializeEnemies();
    }

    private void initializeEnemies() {
        // Add enemies to the list, e.g., new Enemy(...)
    }

    public void start() {
        while (isRunning) {
            update();
            render();
            checkGameOver();
        }
        System.out.println("Game Over! Your score: " + score);
    }

    private void update() {
        // Update game state: player, enemies, etc.

        // Example: Move enemies, check for collisions, etc.
        for (Enemy enemy : enemies) {
            enemy.move();
            if (player.collidesWith(enemy)) {
                player.takeDamage();
            }
        }

        // Handle player input (you need to implement this)
        handlePlayerInput();
    }

    private void render() {
        // Render game state to the console
        // This could be as simple as printing out the current status
        System.out.println("Player Health: " + player.getHealth());
        System.out.println("Enemies: " + enemies.size());
        // Add more rendering details as needed
    }

    private void checkGameOver() {
        if (player.getHealth() <= 0) {
            isRunning = false;
        }
    }

    private void handlePlayerInput() {
        // Read player input from console and act accordingly
        // Example: Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        // String command = scanner.nextLine();
        // processCommand(command);
    }

    // Additional methods to process player commands, manage game state, etc.
}
```

### Key Points:
- **Game Loop**: The `start` method contains the game loop, which continually updates and renders the game state until the game is over.
- **State Management**: The game state is managed by updating player and enemy positions, checking for collisions, and handling player input.
- **Rendering**: In a console-based game, rendering involves printing out the game's state to the console.
- **Player Input**: Handling player input is crucial. This example uses a method placeholder (`handlePlayerInput`), which you'll need to implement based on your game's design.

Remember, this is a basic structure. You'll need to flesh out the details and implement additional functionality as per your game design, such as command processing, detailed collision detection, and more sophisticated enemy AI.
