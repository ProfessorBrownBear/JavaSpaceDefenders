Creating an object interaction diagram for your "Space Defenders" game involves illustrating the relationships and method calls between the `Game`, `Player`, `Enemy`, and `Weapon` classes. 
This diagram will help visualize how instances of these classes interact during the gameplay. 

Let's break down the interactions:

1. **Game - Player Interaction**:
   - The `Game` class creates an instance of the `Player`.
   - It calls methods on `Player`, such as `move`, `takeDamage`, and `attack`.

2. **Game - Enemy Interaction**:
   - The `Game` class creates instances of `Enemy`.
   - It calls methods on `Enemy`, like `advance` and `takeDamage`.
   - It also checks for collisions between `Player` and `Enemy`.

3. **Game - Weapon Interaction**:
   - The `Game` class creates an instance of `Weapon` and assigns it to the `Player`.
   - The `Player` uses the `Weapon` to attack, involving method calls like `use` and `reload`.

4. **Player - Weapon Interaction**:
   - The `Player` class can hold a reference to a `Weapon` and use its methods.

I will create an object interaction diagram based on these interactions.

```plaintext
Game - creates -> Player
      - creates -> Enemy
      - creates -> Weapon
      - calls -> Player.move(), Player.takeDamage(), Player.attack()
      - calls -> Enemy.advance(), Enemy.takeDamage()
      - checks -> collision between Player and Enemy
      - calls -> Weapon.use(), Weapon.reload()

Player - holds reference to -> Weapon
       - calls -> Weapon.use(), Weapon.reload()
```

This diagram is a high-level overview. In a more detailed diagram, you could include specific method parameters, return types, and more granular interactions. The diagram provides a clear picture of how objects in your game are related and interact with each other, which is crucial for understanding the flow and structure of your game's code.
