Creating a `Weapon` class for your "Space Defenders" game is a great way to introduce variety and strategy into the gameplay. The `Weapon` class will define various weapons or defenses that the player can use. This class can include properties such as damage, range, ammo, and special effects, and methods for using the weapon. Here's a basic structure for the `Weapon` class:

```java
public class Weapon {
    private String name;
    private int damage;
    private int range;
    private int ammo;
    private boolean isRangedWeapon;

    public Weapon(String name, int damage, int range, int ammo, boolean isRangedWeapon) {
        this.name = name;
        this.damage = damage;
        this.range = range;
        this.ammo = ammo;
        this.isRangedWeapon = isRangedWeapon;
    }

    // Method to use the weapon
    public void use() {
        if (ammo > 0) {
            // Implement the logic for using the weapon
            // This could involve reducing ammo and applying damage to an enemy
            ammo--;
            System.out.println(name + " used. Remaining ammo: " + ammo);
        } else {
            System.out.println(name + " is out of ammo!");
        }
    }

    // Method to reload the weapon
    public void reload(int additionalAmmo) {
        this.ammo += additionalAmmo;
        System.out.println(name + " reloaded. Total ammo: " + ammo);
    }

    // Getters
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getDamage() {
        return damage;
    }

    public int getRange() {
        return range;
    }

    public int getAmmo() {
        return ammo;
    }

    public boolean isRangedWeapon() {
        return isRangedWeapon;
    }

    // Setters, if needed, can be added here
}
```

### Key Components:

- **Properties**: Name, damage, range, ammo, and a flag to indicate if it's a ranged weapon.
- **Use Weapon**: The `use` method simulates the action of using the weapon. It decreases the ammo and can be expanded to include logic for applying damage to enemies.
- **Reload Weapon**: The `reload` method allows for the replenishment of ammo.

This structure provides a basic framework for the weapon class. Depending on your game's design, you might want to add more complex features like weapon durability, different types of ammo, or special abilities. The weapon system is a crucial part of many games, adding depth and strategy, so feel free to get creative with this class!
